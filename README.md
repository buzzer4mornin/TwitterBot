# Custome TwitterBot

Bot is created using SeleniumLibrary

All is implemented under single class with multiple functions, so everytime code is run, bot has flexibility via different random time intervals provided by input arguments.

Actions such as scroll/tweet/retweet/like/visit_hashtag can be combined with desirable time intervals between one another
