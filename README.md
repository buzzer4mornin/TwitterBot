# Custome TwitterBot

Bot is created using SeleniumLibrary

All is implemented under single class with multiple functions, so everytime code is run, we can pass different random time intervals to bot's actions.

Actions such as scroll/tweet/retweet/like/visit_hashtag can be combined with desirable time intervals between one another
